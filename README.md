# Array Method Drills

### Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.f

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode. Follow the instructions below to complete the Lab.

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your local directory.

```
npm test
```

This will run the test output once.

Two arrays to work with

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0];

const panagram = [
  "The",
  "quick",
  "brown",
  "fox",
  "jumps",
  "over",
  "the",
  "lazy",
  "dog",
];
```

The first question is for the numbers array. The second question is for the words array.

You don't have to write an answer to the thought questions.

#### Every

1. Determine if every number is greater than or equal to 2
1. determine if every word shorter than 7 characters

#### Filter

1. filter the array for numbers less than 5
1. filter words that have an odd length

#### Find

1. Find the first value divisible by 4
1. find the first word that is longer than 4 characters

#### Find Index

1. find the index of the first number that is divisible by 3
1. find the index of the first word that is less than 2 characters long

#### For Each

1. console.log each value of the nums array multiplied by 3
1. console.log each word with an exclamation point at the end of it

**Thought Questions**

- What happened to the original array?
- Can you store the values from a `forEach` method in a new array?

#### Map

1. Make a new array of each number squared and then multiplied by their index number
1. Make a new array of all the words in all uppercase

**Thought Questions**

- What happened to the original array?
- Can you store the values from a `map` method in a new array?

#### Some

- Find out if some numbers are divisible by 7
- Find out if some words have the letter `a` in them

### Hungry for More

#### Reduce

- Add all the numbers in the array together using the `reduce` method
- concatenate all the words using reduce

**Thought Questions**

- What happened to the original array?

#### Sort

- Try to sort without any arguments, do you get what you'd expect with the numbers array?
- Try to sort without any arguments, do you get what you'd expect with the words array?
- Sort the numbers in ascending order
- Sort the numbers in descending order
- Sort the words in ascending order
- Sort the words in descending order

**Thought Questions**

- What happened to the original array?

### Array Methods Challenge Problems

#### isPanagram

Using the following array - test whether each letter a-z (case insensitive) is used at least once

```js
const panagram = [
  "The",
  "quick",
  "brown",
  "fox",
  "jumps",
  "over",
  "the",
  "lazy",
  "dog",
];
```

#### Working with data

- filter for products with a price that is less than 10, using the array below:
- sort alphabetically by product name

```js
const products = [
  {
    name: "fairy lights",
    price: 5.99,
    description: "festive holiday decoration",
  },
  {
    name: "banana",
    price: 0.99,
    description: "full of potassium",
  },
  {
    name: "egg separator",
    price: 3.99,
    description: "it separates yolks from whites",
  },
  {
    name: "flag",
    price: 5.99,
    description: "catches the breeze",
  },
  {
    name: "quark",
    price: 0.01,
    description: "Very small",
  },
  {
    name: "turtleneck",
    price: 19.99,
    description: "available in black and slightly-darker black",
  },
  {
    name: "mitt (leather)",
    price: 15,
    description: "regulation sized",
  },
  {
    name: "nothing",
    price: 10,
    description: "Hey, if you pay us, we won't ask any questions.",
  },
  {
    name: "violin",
    price: 2000,
    description: "Talk about a JS fiddle...",
  },
  {
    name: "yoyo",
    price: 1,
    description: "We had to pull some strings to get this one in.",
  },
];
```
